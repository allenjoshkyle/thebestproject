You begin in a world trapped with monsters and wanderers, your mission is to become the 
strongest hero alive. In this game, you will battle monsters, but they will not die.
You will be able to test your strength and strategic skills. On the second console window
shows your health, your money, and your attack damage. When you find items on the maps, you 
can increase your damage, but think wisely on which ones you want to choose FIRST. The buildings
all include people that want to help you on your journey for a small price. Everytime, you win
a battle, you will obtain gold, which you can use to heal yourself. When you reach zero health,
you will be slain, so do not understimate your enemies. If you are feeling tough, challenge 
yourself by heading to the dungeon in the hole on the northeast part of the map. You cannot 
walk through trees nor can you walk through buildings. You are not able to step out of bounds 
or get by the machines. Now, I ask one thing, what is your name adventurer?
